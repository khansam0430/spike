# Project Name

Spike Weekend Challenge

## Description
This project is a weekend challenge in which I attempted to do something I haven't done before. In this case, I used CSS Transition and Transition Groups to add transition animation between 2 different links. I plan to use this on my upcoming projects so it was good practice. I was able to get it done and looking how I want it to look for testing purposes. I plan to expand my front end transition knowledge so that I can have seamless transitions for my future projects.
